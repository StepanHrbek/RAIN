This is mp3 decoder library for RAIN.
It is based on amp11.

If you want to use this source for anything else than making RAIN,
please, get original amp11.
This derived distribution is highly illegal and I'll be surely banned.

Compile with Watcom C/C++.

My changes/bugfixes in decoder:
-file doesn't have to start with an audio header (FF Fx)
