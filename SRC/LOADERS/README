loader1.*  - universal application loader, tries to run app only with rain,
             use when running app without sound has no sense     
loader2.*  - as loader1, but in case of failure it offers app without rain,
             in case of no soundcard it runs app immediately without rain,
             use when app without sound is still better than nothing
w-32-dos   - the same loaders designed for Watcom-32bit-DOS applications

Q: How to use loaders?
A: Your application is expected to be .exe file, for example myapp.exe.
   Rename loader to myapp.com. Add rain.exe and rain.le to the same
   directory. Command "myapp" then runs your application with rain,
   "myapp.exe" without rain.

Q: Are loaders necessary?
A: No, you can see what they do and do it yourself,
   but it is recommended and it is much easier to use them.

Q: Why Watcom-32bit-DOS clients require different loaders?
A: Default loaders set DOS4G environment variable to limit memory
   allocated by DOS4GW (=used by RAIN server!) to 3MB. The rest is for client.
   In case of Watcom-32bit-DOS client, both client and server use DOS4GW
   and share memory, so it would be bad to limit them to 3MB.
